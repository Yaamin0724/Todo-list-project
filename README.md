# Todo-list-project
Welcome to my project.The intent behind this project was to practice React. I had to pick up react from scratch in a month for an internship and after finishing the course they provided,I chose to put my knowledge to the test through this app. This was a code-along project that I believed would be an optimal challenge to test my react base.  

App Description:
For practicing, I could have chosen to do a generic website but I wanted to build something that I could use on a day to day basis. I made this while I was an undergrad student and the amount of daily tasks that needed to be done piled up beyond one's mind can handle.

Hence I built this simple application that can
1. record my day's tasks
2. edit them if required
3. click on them to cancel tasks out, once one is completed. 

useState,useEffect,Parent to child data flow (via props) as well as inverse data flow(Parent passing down function as a prop) from child to parent has been implemented at large. 
As I shall be using it on a regular basis, heavy emphasis on styling was done as well.
